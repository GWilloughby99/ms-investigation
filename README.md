<h3> Get the data </h3>

 <h3> Methodology </h3>
 <p>
  All the data in this piece was acquired using Freedom of Information requests. National data was difficult to obtain, so a localised approached requesting data from hospitals proved to be the most effective strategy.

  <h3> MRI scans </h3>
  
  <p> Scans help determine a diagnosis and help track disease progression. MRI scans, much like other aspects of treatment for MS, have fallen. Fewer scans add to concerns of worse disability and more advanced health challenges. </p>
