<h3> Get the data </h3>
<p>
  To access the data used in this article, it can be found in the <i>data</i> section of this repo which is under <i>docs</i>.

 <h3> Methodology </h3>
 <p>
  All the data in this piece was acquired using Freedom of Information requests. National data was difficult to obtain, so a localised approached requesting data from hospitals proved to be the most effective strategy.

  <h3> MRI scans </h3>
  
  <p> Scans help determine a diagnosis and help track disease progression. MRI scans, much like other aspects of treatment for MS, have fallen. Fewer scans add to concerns of worse disability and a more advanced health challenges. </p>
