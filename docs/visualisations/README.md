 <h1> Visualising the project </h1>
 
 <blockquote> All the visualisations used in this investigation were created in <i>Flourish</i>. There is a combination of standard graphics and use of the story option. </blockquote>
 
 <p> The aim for the graphics was to highlight the human behind the numbers. This was achieved through interviewing case studies, but the visualisations can also convey the scale of missed care. This is particularly evident in the story animation with a shaded area indicating the decrease in MRI scans </p>
