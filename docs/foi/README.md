Dear Sir or Madam,  

My name is George Willoughby, and Iâ€™m a freelance journalist. I am sending this request under the Freedom of Information Act to ask for the following information.

1.   A breakdown of the number of MRI scans that Multiple Sclerosis patients have had in Salford Royal Hospital for the following period: 1 January 2021-31 March 2021.
Please could you provide the information in the form of a table.


2.   A monthly breakdown of the number of face-to-face appointments MS patients have had with specialist MS nurses in Salford Royal hospital for the following period: 1 January 2021-31 March 2021.
Please could you provide the information as a table.

 

3. The total number of neurology appointments that took place in Salford Royal Hospital or online for those with multiple sclerosis for the following period: 1 January 2021-31 March 2021.
Please could you provide the information as a table.


If it is not possible to provide the information requested due to the information exceeding the cost of compliance limits identified in Section 12, please provide advice and assistance, under the Section 16 obligations of the Act, as to how I can refine my request.

 

Under FOI guidelines you have 20 working days to answer these questions. Please acknowledge receipt of this request.

 

**If you are not the right person to deal with this request, please would you kindly pass it to the appropriate colleague and ask them to deal with it?**

 

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

 

George Willoughby
